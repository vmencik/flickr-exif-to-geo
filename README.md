flickr-exif-to-geo
------------------
A rather rudimentary tool that can read location coordinates from EXIF data
stored in photos on Flickr and save them as location metadata so that Flickr
can display the location on photo's detail page and on the map.

It uses Flickr REST API via [Flickr4Java](https://github.com/callmeal/Flickr4Java).

This tool is not well tested and most definitely not robust. It was used only one for author's own Flickr albums.
